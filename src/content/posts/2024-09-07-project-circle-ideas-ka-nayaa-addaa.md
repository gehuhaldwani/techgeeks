## A New Initiative Takes Flight

The Tech Club’s _Project Circle_ is something students had been eagerly looking forward to, and the first day did not disappoint. This new student-led initiative was set up to be a space for brainstorming, discussing, and developing ideas, all without any teacher involvement. The aim was to give students a chance to use their creativity and technical skills freely. When the first meeting kicked off, it was a big deal for many. The excitement was obvious as students gathered, ready to dive into meaningful discussions and teamwork. It was a fresh start for those looking to explore new ideas and work together.

## Initial Reactions and Expectations

When students first arrived, there was a mix of excitement and uncertainty. Many were unsure of what to expect, which is pretty normal when starting something new. The question **“Akhir hogaa kya ismee?”** was on a lot of minds, showing their curiosity and a bit of doubt about the new setup. Still, the room was vibing with anticipation. **Students were eager to find out what the Project Circle had to offer and how it could benefit them.**

## From Ideas to Action

As the meeting went on, the initial nerves gave way to a lively exchange of ideas. Students started sharing their projects and concepts, showcasing their creativity and technical skills.

*   One standout idea was a **"College-Specific OLX"** **—** a platform tailored specifically for the college community, allowing students to buy, sell, and trade items within the campus. This concept aimed to make transactions easier and more efficient by focusing solely on the needs of students.
    
*   Another exciting proposal was a **"Gesture-Controlled PowerPoint Tool".** This innovative tool would enable users to control presentations using hand gestures, making the presentation process more interactive and dynamic. It was clear that this idea could significantly enhance the way presentations are delivered and engaged with.
    
*   Additionally, a new idea emerged for a “**Food Court-like app-based Booking System”** designed for the college cafeteria and tuck shops. The proposed system would use QR codes placed on tables. Students could scan these codes to place their orders directly from their phones and then wait for notifications when their food was ready. This approach aimed to streamline the ordering process, reduce wait times, and improve overall convenience for students.
    
*   Another proposal introduced was an **“E-Certificate Generation tool for College Clubs”.** This tool would simplify the process of creating and managing certificates for various club activities. By automating certificate generation, the tool was expected to enhance productivity and ensure that students could easily recognize and reward their peers' efforts.
    

These discussions gave students a chance to present their ideas and get feedback. It was also a great opportunity for teamwork and refining concepts. The feedback helped improve ideas and encouraged deeper thinking about projects.

## Looking Ahead

The first day of the Project Circle was more than just a meeting; it was a peek into the potential for student innovation and teamwork. The circle showed it could be a great way for students to share ideas, get valuable feedback, and connect with others. Senior students also played a role, offering advice and sharing their experiences.

Overall, the hour in LT-1 was a promising start. The Project Circle has the chance to become a key part of college life, fostering creativity, learning, and collaboration. As it continues to grow, it promises to be a lively centre for student ideas and a valuable resource for making the most of college.
