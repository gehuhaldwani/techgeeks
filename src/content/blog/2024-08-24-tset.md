Excitement filled the air as we, the members of the Tech Club, eagerly anticipated the start of our induction program on August 20, 2024. The day marked the beginning of a new chapter for the freshers, and we were thrilled to welcome them into the vibrant community that our club has become over the years.

## A Warm Welcome to New Beginnings

At 9:30 AM sharp, the program kicked off with a warm and heartfelt welcome to the new students. The auditorium buzzed with energy as members took the stage to introduce the Tech Club. Their presentation were reflecting the passion and dedication that each member of the club brings to the table.

They began by outlining the objectives of the Tech Club, emphasizing our mission to foster innovation, creativity, and technical prowess among students. The slides that followed were a visual treat, showcasing the club’s past events. From intense coding competitions and challenging webathons to intellectually stimulating quizzes, hands-on workshops, and thrilling esports gaming events, every event was brought to life through captivating photos that captured the spirit and enthusiasm of our members. The new students watched intently, some already imagining themselves as part of these exciting activities.

## Looking Forward: Upcoming Events

With the introduction complete, we shifted our focus to what lies ahead. The new members listened eagerly as we announced our upcoming events, which promise to be even more exhilarating. In August, we’re gearing up for our flagship event, CodeNOVA 2.0—a coding competition that tests not only technical skills but also creativity and problem-solving under pressure. We could see the curiosity and excitement in the eyes of the freshers as we teased the details.

Looking further ahead, we hinted at special plans for September 15, a day dedicated to celebrating the spirit of engineering. Although we didn’t reveal everything, we assured them that the event would be one of the highlights of the year, filled with activities that would challenge and inspire them.

## Igniting the Competitive Spirit: Tech Quiz

The atmosphere in the room shifted as we transitioned to the more interactive part of the program—the tech quiz. The freshers were divided into two teams, and the competitive spirit quickly took over. We posed questions to each team alternately, covering a range of topics from general technology to specific programming languages and current trends in the tech world.

It was a lively session, filled with moments of suspense and bursts of laughter. To keep things fun and light-hearted, we awarded chocolates to the winners—a small but sweet reward for their efforts.

## Infinity Loop Game

Next on the agenda was the Infinity Loop game, a fun and slightly challenging activity that required both creativity and coordination. Two participants stood facing each other with a ribbon or string tied loosely around their wrists or hands. The ribbon was arranged in such a way that it formed a loop connecting both participants, almost like a handcuff. The objective was simple yet tricky: to "unlock" themselves from each other without untying or breaking the ribbon.

This game brought out the problem-solving skills of the participants, as they tried various techniques to free themselves. The crowd watched with bated breath, cheering them on, and offering suggestions. The game was a perfect icebreaker, fostering teamwork and encouraging the students to think outside the box.

## Lights, Camera, Action: Movie Quiz

After the Infinity Loop game, we shifted gears to a movie quiz. The rules remained the same as the tech quiz, but this time, the atmosphere was noticeably more relaxed. The students, now more comfortable and confident, participated with gusto. The quiz featured questions from popular movies, testing the students’ knowledge of cinema. The lively competition brought smiles and laughter, making it an enjoyable experience for everyone involved.

## Words of Wisdom

As the games wrapped up, our club coordinator, Ms. Richa Pandey, took the stage. Her presence commanded attention, and her words resonated with everyone in the room. She shared her personal journey with the Tech Club, recounting its humble beginnings and how it has grown over the years. Her stories of perseverance, teamwork, and innovation were not just inspiring but also a reminder of the endless possibilities that lie ahead for the new members.

Ms. Pandey’s speech was a testament to the hard work and dedication that has gone into building the Tech Club. She spoke about the sense of community and belonging that the club offers, encouraging the freshers to actively participate and make the most of the opportunities available. To conclude her speech, she invited all the current Tech Club members to join her on stage for a group photo—a moment that captured the unity and pride that defines our team.

## A Joyful Conclusion: Games and Connections

The final segment of the program was all about fun and interaction. We organized a series of games. Both new students and club members enthusiastically participated, leading to a joyful and engaging conclusion to the day’s activities. The Balloon game had everyone on their toes, while the Cup game tested their balance and coordination, leading to many light hearten moments.

Before we wrapped up the event, we made sure to share the club’s social media pages. We encouraged everyone to stay connected and informed about future events, fostering a sense of community that extends beyond the confines of the campus.

## Final Thoughts

As the induction program came to an end, the energy in the room was palpable. The freshers left with smiles on their faces, eager to become a part of the Tech Club and contribute to its legacy. For us, the members of the Tech Club, the day was a resounding success, filled with laughter, learning, and the promise of new friendships and collaborations.
