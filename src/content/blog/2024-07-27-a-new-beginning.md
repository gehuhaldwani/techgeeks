## Hello Geeks!

As the new academic year begins, we're excited to usher in a fresh wave of energy and innovation at TechGeeks. This year marks a new beginning for our club, and we can't wait to share our plans and activities with you all.

### Here's a glimpse of what's in store:

- **Monthly Coding Tests**: This year we plan to conduct monthly coding tests to help you sharpen your skills and stay ahead of the curve.

- **Web Development Competitions**: Webathon is back! Showcase your web development skills and compete with your peers.

- **Tech Quizzes**: Test your tech knowledge in our fun and challenging quizzes.

- **Diverse Events and Workshops**: Alongside our coding tests, we'll be hosting a range of events, including workshops, guest lectures, and hands-on projects. Whether you're interested in AI, web development, cybersecurity, or something else, there's an event for you.

## A Fresh Approach: Our New Event Strategy

We understand that many students worry about committing to a club and not being able to participate in events. This year, we've introduced a new system to ensure everyone gets a chance to shine. We're forming two internal teams that will alternate hosting events every month. This not only provides flexibility but also ensures a continuous stream of activities and learning opportunities.

## Calling All Talents: We Need You!

TechGeeks isn't just about coding; it's a community where all skills are valued. We're looking for talented individuals who can contribute in various ways:

- **Core Event Organizers**: Help us plan and execute exciting events and workshops.
- **Developers / Coders / Geeks**: Who can help us in conducting coding tests, workshops, and competitions.
- **Social Media Managers**: Spread the word about TechGeeks and engage with our community.
- **Content Writers**: Help us share our stories, achievements, and events with the world.
- **Photographers**: Capture the exciting moments and memories from our events.
- **Report Makers**: Document our activities and help us keep track of our progress.
- **Graphic Designers**: Bring creativity and flair to our visual content.
- **And More**: Whatever your talent, there's a place for you in TechGeeks!

Whether you're a tech enthusiast or have a passion for writing, photography, or design, we welcome you to join our team. This is a fantastic opportunity to develop your skills, work on exciting projects, and be part of a supportive community.

## Announcing Our New eSports Organizing Committee

In addition to our tech-focused events, we're thrilled to announce the formation of a dedicated eSports organizing committee. As eSports continues to grow in popularity, we recognize the need for a structured approach to hosting and participating in gaming tournaments. This committee will be responsible for:

- **Organizing Regular Tournaments**: From popular mobile titles like BGMI and Free Fire to emerging favorites, we'll be hosting regular tournaments to cater to various gaming interests.
- **Building Competitive Teams**: We'll form and support competitive teams to represent our college in inter-collegiate eSports competitions.

If you're passionate about gaming and want to be part of this exciting venture, we encourage you to join our eSports committee. Whether you're a player, organizer, or strategist, there's a role for you.

## A Big Thank You to Our Seniors

As we embark on this new journey, we also want to thank our outgoing seniors. Your contributions have laid a strong foundation for TechGeeks, and your spirit will continue to inspire us. We wish you all the best in your future endeavors and hope to see you back as guest speakers or mentors!

Let's make this year at TechGeeks a memorable one, filled with learning, growth, and fun. Stay tuned for more updates, and we look forward to seeing you at our first meeting!

Sincerely,  
**The TechGeeks Team**
